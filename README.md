# catalog api

### The Challenge

Your task is to develop an API for a product catalog management system in a marketplace application. You should analyze and convert the following user stories into routes for the application:

#### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to register a product with its owner, so that I can access its data in the future (title, description, price, category, owner ID).

- As a user, I want to register a category with its owner, so that I can access its data in the future (title, description, owner ID).

- As a user, I want to associate a product with a category.

- As a user, I want to update the data of a product or category.

- As a user, I want to delete a product or category from my catalog.

- A product can only be associated with one category at a time.

- Assume that products and categories belong only to one owner.
